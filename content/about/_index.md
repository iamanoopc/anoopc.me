Hello, I am Anoop Chandran. I am a  Front-end developer. I have 5 years commercial experience providing responsive front-end development and Website Design requirements. I consider design to be just as important as development and aim to combine both to produce high quality user experience.

I live near Whampoa Harbor in Hong Kong with my beautiful wife and son. I hold various skills under my belt and experienced in numerous job profiles before settling down as a FrontEnd Developer.
