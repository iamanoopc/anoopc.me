<h5>Tic Tac Toe game app created for FreeCodeCamp</h5>
<p>I spent lot of time for this one. I was still not able to make the AI unbeatable. However it has a pretty decent AI for an average player. If you are not watching the computer might just win the game. :) Also I am close to employ the minimax algorithm for this one.</p>
<p> I used React for this project, little bit of css transitions using react-transition-group. </p>
