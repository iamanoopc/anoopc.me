<h5>Local weather app created for FreeCodecamp</h5>
<p> This is a very simple weather application to show your local weather</p>
<p>This application identifies your ip adress and thus your location and then makes a request to openweather API to retreive the weather information</p>
<p>It looks painfully simple now, I promise I have plans for this one :)</p>
