<h5>This is the HTML mockup of dashboard created for Twenty20 App</h5>
<p><i>I got a chance to work at this project while working with CircusSocial Pvt. Ltd.</i><p/>
<p>Twenty20 was an awesome project aiming the digital marketing sector. <br/>It is like a live-data-tracking tools dashboard. Data can be related to marketing, social and statistics. <br/>I wrote the html and css; and integrated a wonderful gallery plugin.<br/><p/>
<mark>This is not the final production ready code. This is just the initial rough mockup</mark>
